            <h1>How I Joined ALX</h1>
            <p>I joined ALX in January 2025 because I was drawn to the comprehensive courses they offer—many of which I had always wanted to learn but couldn't find in one place elsewhere. The depth of information and the practical skills taught in ALX are unlike anything I'd seen on other learning platforms. When I received my acceptance into the program, I was so excited to begin this journey and take the first step toward becoming a professional in the tech industry.</p>

            <h2>My First Course: Professional Foundations</h2>
            <p>My first course at ALX was Professional Foundations, and I was immediately impressed. It gave me real-world skills that are essential in any workplace. Through this course, I learned about teamwork, research, storytelling, critical thinking, and empathy. It wasn’t always easy—balancing time, staying mentally strong, and meeting deadlines were all challenging. But those same challenges helped me grow, making the experience deeply rewarding.</p>

            <h3>Exploring Front-End Programming</h3>
            <p>After Professional Foundations, I moved into front-end programming and began learning the basics of Git, GitHub, HTML, and JavaScript. My favorite part so far has been diving into JavaScript—especially exploring how to manipulate the DOM and build interactive elements. I’ve especially enjoyed creating small projects using HTML and JavaScript, which have helped me understand how websites work behind the scenes and how I can bring them to life.</p>
