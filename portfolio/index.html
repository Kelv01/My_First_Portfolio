        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate software engineer driven by a mission to tackle unemployment through innovation and skills development. Inspired by the Job Creation GCGO, I focus on creating solutions that equip youth and marginalized communities with the tools they need to thrive in todayâ€™s tech-driven economy.
        With a specialization in Software Engineering, Iâ€™m constantly learning, coding, and collaborating to bring ideas to life. My goal is not just to build software but to open doors â€” whether through mentorship, training, or developing employment-ready platforms.
        I believe in learning something new every day, embracing challenges, and always being ready to ask questions and improve.
        Outside of tech, Iâ€™m also a music producer with a knack for creating beats â€” and yes, my singing voice and speaking voice sound totally different! ðŸŽ¶
